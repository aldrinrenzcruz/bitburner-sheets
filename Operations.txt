-------------------------------------------------------------

2. Operation Zero - Stealth

AeroCorp is one of the world's largest defense contractors. Its leader, Steve Watataki, is thought to be a supporter of Synthoid rights. He must be removed.

The goal of Operation Zero is to covertly infiltrate AeroCorp and uncover any incriminating evidence or information against Watataki that will cause him to be removed from his position at AeroCorp. Incriminating evidence can be fabricated as a last resort. Be warned that AeroCorp has some of the most advanced security measures in the world.

3. Operation X - Retirement

We have recently discovered an underground publication group called Samizdat. Even though most of their publications are nonsensical conspiracy theories, the average human is gullible enough to believe them. Many of their works discuss Synthoids and pose a threat to society. The publications are spreading rapidly in China and other Eastern countries.

Samizdat has done a good job of keeping hidden and anonymous. However, we've just received intelligence that their base of operations is in Ishima's underground sewer systems. Your task is to investigate the sewer systems, and eliminate Samizdat. They must never publish anything again.

4. Operation Titan - Retirement

Several months ago Titan Laboratories' Bioengineering department was infiltrated by Synthoids. As far as we know, Titan Laboratories' management has no knowledge about this. We don't know what the Synthoids are up to, but the research that they could be conducting using Titan Laboraties' vast resources is potentially very dangerous.

Your goal is to enter and destroy the Bioengineering department's facility in Aevum. The task is not just to retire the Synthoids there, but also to destroy any information or research at the facility that is relevant to the Synthoids and their goals.

5. Operation Ares - Retirement

One of our undercover agents, Agent Carter, has informed us of a massive weapons deal going down in Dubai between rogue Russian militants and a radical Synthoid community. These weapons are next-gen plasma and energy weapons. It is critical for the safety of humanity that this deal does not happen.

Your task is to intercept the deal. Leave no survivors.

6. Operation Archangel - Retirement

Our analysts have discovered that the popular Red Rabbit brothel in Amsterdam is run and 'staffed' by MK-VI Synthoids. Intelligence suggests that the profit from this brothel is used to fund a large black market arms trafficking operation.

The goal of this operation is to take out the leaders that are running the Red Rabbit brothel. Try to limit the number of other casualties, but do what you must to complete the mission.

7. Operation Juggernaut

The CIA has just encountered a new security threat. A new criminal group, lead by a shadowy operative who calls himself Juggernaut, has been smuggling drugs and weapons (including suspected bioweapons) into Sector-12. We also have reason to believe they tried to break into one of Universal Energy's facilities in order to cause a city-wide blackout. The CIA suspects that Juggernaut is a heavily-augmented Synthoid, and have thus enlisted our help.

Your mission is to eradicate Juggernaut and his followers.

8. Operation Red Dragon - Retirement

The Tetrads criminal organization is suspected of reverse-engineering the MK-VI Synthoid design. We believe they altered and possibly improved the design and began manufacturing their own Synthoid models in order to bolster their criminal activities.

Your task is to infiltrate and destroy the Tetrads' base of operations in Los Angeles. Intelligence tells us that their base houses one of their Synthoid manufacturing units.
