1. Operation Typhoon - Stealth

Obadiah Zenyatta is the leader of a RedWater PMC. It has long been known among the intelligence community that Zenyatta, along with the rest of the PMC, is a Synthoid.

The goal of Operation Typhoon is to find and eliminate Zenyatta and RedWater by any means necessary. After the task is completed, the actions must be covered up from the general public.

Required Rank: 2,500
-------------------------------------------------------------

2. Operation Zero - Stealth

AeroCorp is one of the world's largest defense contractors. Its leader, Steve Watataki, is thought to be a supporter of Synthoid rights. He must be removed.

The goal of Operation Zero is to covertly infiltrate AeroCorp and uncover any incriminating evidence or information against Watataki that will cause him to be removed from his position at AeroCorp. Incriminating evidence can be fabricated as a last resort. Be warned that AeroCorp has some of the most advanced security measures in the world.

3. Operation X - Retirement

We have recently discovered an underground publication group called Samizdat. Even though most of their publications are nonsensical conspiracy theories, the average human is gullible enough to believe them. Many of their works discuss Synthoids and pose a threat to society. The publications are spreading rapidly in China and other Eastern countries.

Samizdat has done a good job of keeping hidden and anonymous. However, we've just received intelligence that their base of operations is in Ishima's underground sewer systems. Your task is to investigate the sewer systems, and eliminate Samizdat. They must never publish anything again.

Required Rank: 7,500

-------------------------------------------------------------

4. Operation Titan - Retirement

Several months ago Titan Laboratories' Bioengineering department was infiltrated by Synthoids. As far as we know, Titan Laboratories' management has no knowledge about this. We don't know what the Synthoids are up to, but the research that they could be conducting using Titan Laboraties' vast resources is potentially very dangerous.

Your goal is to enter and destroy the Bioengineering department's facility in Aevum. The task is not just to retire the Synthoids there, but also to destroy any information or research at the facility that is relevant to the Synthoids and their goals.

Required Rank: 10,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

5. Operation Ares - Retirement

One of our undercover agents, Agent Carter, has informed us of a massive weapons deal going down in Dubai between rogue Russian militants and a radical Synthoid community. These weapons are next-gen plasma and energy weapons. It is critical for the safety of humanity that this deal does not happen.

Your task is to intercept the deal. Leave no survivors.

Required Rank: 12,500

-------------------------------------------------------------

6. Operation Archangel - Retirement

Our analysts have discovered that the popular Red Rabbit brothel in Amsterdam is run and 'staffed' by MK-VI Synthoids. Intelligence suggests that the profit from this brothel is used to fund a large black market arms trafficking operation.

The goal of this operation is to take out the leaders that are running the Red Rabbit brothel. Try to limit the number of other casualties, but do what you must to complete the mission.

Required Rank: 15,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

7. Operation Juggernaut

The CIA has just encountered a new security threat. A new criminal group, lead by a shadowy operative who calls himself Juggernaut, has been smuggling drugs and weapons (including suspected bioweapons) into Sector-12. We also have reason to believe they tried to break into one of Universal Energy's facilities in order to cause a city-wide blackout. The CIA suspects that Juggernaut is a heavily-augmented Synthoid, and have thus enlisted our help.

Your mission is to eradicate Juggernaut and his followers.

Required Rank: 20,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

8. Operation Red Dragon - Retirement

The Tetrads criminal organization is suspected of reverse-engineering the MK-VI Synthoid design. We believe they altered and possibly improved the design and began manufacturing their own Synthoid models in order to bolster their criminal activities.

Your task is to infiltrate and destroy the Tetrads' base of operations in Los Angeles. Intelligence tells us that their base houses one of their Synthoid manufacturing units.

Required Rank: 25,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

9. Operation K - Retirement

CODE RED SITUATION. Our intelligence tells us that VitaLife has discovered a new android cloning technology. This technology is supposedly capable of cloning Synthoids, not only physically but also their advanced AI modules. We do not believe that VitaLife is trying to use this technology illegally or maliciously, but if any Synthoids were able to infiltrate the corporation and take advantage of this technology then the results would be catastrophic.

We do not have the power or jurisdiction to shut this down through legal or political means, so we must resort to a covert operation. Your goal is to destroy this technology and eliminate anyone who was involved in its creation.

Required Rank: 30,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

10. Operation Deckard - Retirement

Despite your success in eliminating VitaLife's new android-replicating technology in Operation K, we've discovered that a small group of MK-VI Synthoids were able to make off with the schematics and design of the technology before the Operation. It is almost a certainty that these Synthoids are some of the rogue MK-VI ones from the Synthoid Uprising.

The goal of Operation Deckard is to hunt down these Synthoids and retire them. I don't need to tell you how critical this mission is.

Required Rank: 40,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

11. Operation Tyrell - Retirement

A week ago Blade Industries reported a small break-in at one of their Aevum Augmentation storage facilities. We figured out that The Dark Army was behind the heist, and didn't think any more of it. However, we've just discovered that several known MK-VI Synthoids were part of that break-in group.

We cannot have Synthoids upgrading their already-enhanced abilities with Augmentations. Your task is to hunt down associated The Dark Army members and eliminate them.

Required Rank: 50,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

12. Operation Wallace - Retirement

Based on information gathered from Operation Tyrell, we've discovered that The Dark Army was well aware that there were Synthoids amongst their ranks. Even worse, we believe that The Dark Army is working together with other criminal organizations such as The Syndicate and that they are planning some sort of large-scale takeover of multiple major cities, most notably Aevum. We suspect that Synthoids have infiltrated the ranks of these criminal factions and are trying to stage another Synthoid uprising.

The best way to deal with this is to prevent it before it even happens. The goal of Operation Wallace is to destroy The Dark Army and Syndicate factions in Aevum immediately. Leave no survivors.

Required Rank: 75,000

13. Operation Shoulder of Orion - Stealth

China's Solaris Space Systems is secretly launching the first manned spacecraft in over a decade using Synthoids. We believe China is trying to establish the first off-world colonies.

The mission is to prevent this launch without instigating an international conflict. When you accept this mission you will be officially disavowed by the NSA and the national government until after you successfully return. In the event of failure, all of the operation's team members must not let themselves be captured alive.

Required Rank: 100,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

14. Operation Hyron - Retirement

Our intelligence tells us that Fulcrum Secret Technologies is developing a quantum supercomputer using human brains as core processors. This supercomputer is rumored to be able to store vast amounts of data and perform computations unmatched by any other supercomputer on the planet. But more importantly, the use of organic human brains means that the supercomputer may be able to reason abstractly and become self-aware.

I do not need to remind you why sentient-level AIs pose a serious threat to all of mankind.

The research for this project is being conducted at one of Fulcrum Secret Technologies secret facilities in Aevum, codenamed 'Alpha Ranch'. Infiltrate the compound, delete and destroy the work, and then find and kill the project lead.

-------------------------------------------------------------

15. Operation Morpheus - Stealth

DreamSense Technologies is an advertising company that uses special technology to transmit their ads into the people's dreams and subconcious. They do this using broadcast transmitter towers. Based on information from our agents and informants in Chongqing, we have reason to believe that one of the broadcast towers there has been compromised by Synthoids and is being used to spread pro-Synthoid propaganda.

The mission is to destroy this broadcast tower. Speed and stealth are of the utmost importance for this.

Required Rank: 150,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

16. Operation Ion Storm - Retirement

Our analysts have uncovered a gathering of MK-VI Synthoids that have taken up residence in the Sector-12 Slums. We don't know if they are rogue Synthoids from the Uprising, but we do know that they have been stockpiling weapons, money, and other resources. This makes them dangerous.

This is a full-scale assault operation to find and retire all of these Synthoids in the Sector-12 Slums.

Required Rank: 175,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

17. Operation Annihilus - Retirement

Our superiors have ordered us to eradicate everything and everyone in an underground facility located in Aevum. They tell us that the facility houses many dangerous Synthoids and belongs to a terrorist organization called 'The Covenant'. We have no prior intelligence about this organization, so you are going in blind.

Required Rank: 200,000

-------------------------------------------------------------

18. Operation Ultron - Retirement

OmniTek Incorporated, the original designer and manufacturer of Synthoids, has notified us of a malfunction in their AI design. This malfunction, when triggered, causes MK-VI Synthoids to become radicalized and seek out the destruction of humanity. They say that this bug affects all MK-VI Synthoids, not just the rogue ones from the Uprising.

OmniTek Incorporated has also told us they believe someone has triggered this malfunction in a large group of MK-VI Synthoids, and that these newly-radicalized Synthoids are now amassing in Volhaven to form a terrorist group called Ultron.

Intelligence suggests Ultron is heavily armed and that their members are augmented. We believe Ultron is making moves to take control of and weaponize DeltaOne's Tactical High-Energy Satellite Laser Array (THESLA).

Your task is to find and destroy Ultron.

Throughout all of humanity's history, we have relied on technology to survive, conquer, and progress. Its advancement became our primary goal. And at the peak of human civilization technology turned into power. Global, absolute power.

It seems that the universe is not without a sense of irony.
