-------------------------------------------------------------

2. Operation Zero - Stealth

AeroCorp is one of the world's largest defense contractors. Its leader, Steve Watataki, is thought to be a supporter of Synthoid rights. He must be removed.

The goal of Operation Zero is to covertly infiltrate AeroCorp and uncover any incriminating evidence or information against Watataki that will cause him to be removed from his position at AeroCorp. Incriminating evidence can be fabricated as a last resort. Be warned that AeroCorp has some of the most advanced security measures in the world.

3. Operation X - Retirement

We have recently discovered an underground publication group called Samizdat. Even though most of their publications are nonsensical conspiracy theories, the average human is gullible enough to believe them. Many of their works discuss Synthoids and pose a threat to society. The publications are spreading rapidly in China and other Eastern countries.

Samizdat has done a good job of keeping hidden and anonymous. However, we've just received intelligence that their base of operations is in Ishima's underground sewer systems. Your task is to investigate the sewer systems, and eliminate Samizdat. They must never publish anything again.

4. Operation Titan - Retirement

Several months ago Titan Laboratories' Bioengineering department was infiltrated by Synthoids. As far as we know, Titan Laboratories' management has no knowledge about this. We don't know what the Synthoids are up to, but the research that they could be conducting using Titan Laboraties' vast resources is potentially very dangerous.

Your goal is to enter and destroy the Bioengineering department's facility in Aevum. The task is not just to retire the Synthoids there, but also to destroy any information or research at the facility that is relevant to the Synthoids and their goals.
